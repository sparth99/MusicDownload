# MusicDownload

A Python scrips that downloads music with album/cover art and all meta data
Run through the terminal

The Current GUI down program has some bugs in it. 

Download the correct dependicies listed on the top of the python file

Change the Location of the directory for your own use

## Example 1

In the songs.txt file, put the names of the songs followed by the artist.

If you don't know the artist, no worries

```
Headlies Drake
DNA Kendrick
Everyday Logic
Sicko Mode
```
## Example 2

The voice recogniton program down_audio.py only reads one song at a time
If you are using a Mac, the program will say 'Say the name of the song'

```
'Say the name of the song'
User's Voice: 'Headlines'
-> Download should start or it will give an error
```

## Extra
The script uses youtube to downloads the mp3.

I am not resposible for any legal issues. For educational puproses only
